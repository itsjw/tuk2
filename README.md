# TUK II - Project #1

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the usage guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Setup

1. Run `./install.sh` to install the dependencies of the `server` and `material-app` packages.
2. In the `material-app` package, run `npm start` to run the server and frontend dev-server.
3. To run the frontend and server separately, run `npm start` in the `server` package and `npm run start-hotreload` in the `material-app` package.
